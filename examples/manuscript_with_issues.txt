Sample Research Paper with Citation Issues

Introduction

This document intentionally contains citation inconsistencies to demonstrate
the Citation Cross-Checker tool's capabilities.

Proper citations exist for some sources (Smith, 2020) and (Johnson, 2021).
However, there are also citations without bibliography entries (Williams, 2019)
and (Garcia et al., 2022).

Some numeric citations are present [1] and [2], but others are missing [5].

Body

Additional content with more citations (Taylor, 2018) and references to
work that will not appear in the bibliography (Brown, 2021).
